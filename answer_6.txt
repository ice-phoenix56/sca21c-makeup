Git Log - It shows a list of all committed commits sorted by date added (most recent on top),
The git log command has a useful -p flag that immediately prints the diff for each commit.
Git Show - Each commit has an identifier (say "hash"), a unique set of characters. 
Using a hash, you can see all the changes made within a single commit.
Git commit hashes are very long and can be awkward to use. Therefore, the Git developers added the ability to specify only part of the hash. 
It is enough to take the first 8 characters.
Git Blame -  For this,the command git blame <path to the file> is suitable. This command outputs the file and next to each line shows who changed it and in what commit.
Git Grep - The git grep command searches for a match for the specified string in all project files. This is a very handy command for quick analysis from the terminal. It is more convenient than regular grep,
because it knows about ignoring and does not look at the .git directory, but it also knows how to search through history.
GitHub - In simple situations,you can analyze the project directly on GitHub. It allows you to view the commit history, changes in a particular commit, and more.
